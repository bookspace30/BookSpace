WAD project Details

1) Group no: 30

2) Our project name : Book Space
3) Our project Idea: Free Book Service

4) Problem Motivation :

The main motivation of the project is to help the poor by giving books for free. The primary focus will be to help the poor, but it will also be helpful to other people as well.


5) Problem Statement :

In these present situations, it is difficult for poor people to even afford food, thus affording money for buying books has become a big burden for their child's education!!


6) Problem Solution :

This website will play a major role in giving books to the poor for free which will be very helpful for them.

The donors will have to donate their old books to our website and we collect them and add them to our website.

The sellers can come to our website and get the books for free of cost from our website.



7) Project Overall Idea :

People who want to donate their books can login to this website and can fill in the details of the book like name,genre and condition of the book.

If the book is in good condition to read, then the user can fill the address and then a pick up guy comes to receive it.

Donors will get points or coupons which will be helpful to buy books from the website with low cost!!

The book will be posted on the website with title, edition, proper photo and grade of the book.

Customers who are interested to buy the book can place an order with only delivery charges and order will be received as soon as possible.

Customers can keep track of order and can contact customer care for any further queries and updates.
